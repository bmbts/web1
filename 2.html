  <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/index.html#contents" target="blank" title="html 5.2 specification">“The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world.”</a>.</strong> “If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.”<br>
  “I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me.”
